//We need to find out the maximum difference 
//(which will be the maximum profit) 
//between two numbers in the given array. 
//Also, the second number (selling price) 
//must be larger than the first one (buying price).

//In formal terms, we need to 
//find max(prices[j] - prices[i])
//max(prices[j]âˆ’prices[i]), 
//for every i and j such that j > i
