```
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, 
two pointer problems and divide and conquer
```

### FREQUENCY COUNTERS

- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings


### MULTIPLE POINTERS

- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

### SLIDING WINDOW


- This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.


### RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
- ##### How recursive functions work
    ```
    Two essential parts of a recursive function!
        - Base Case
        - Different Input
    ```
    - ```Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!```

    - ```Base Case :The condition when the recursion ends. This is the most important concept to understand```
