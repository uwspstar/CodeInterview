```The interview lasts for about half an hour. In the beginning I gave an elevated pitch on my experience. Then there came eight technical questions.
Here are the questions:
- What's best/ worst running time for Merge Sort?
- What's average / worst running time for Quick Sort?
- What's the worst running time for a look up in a Hashtable?
- Could you name an implementation of Hashtable?
- Which of the following Python data structure is not mutable: tuple, list, dictionary?
- For an unweighted graph, which algorithm should be used to find shortest path: breath first search or Diajkstra?
- Could you estimate 2^24?
- In Java, could you name two Map implementations?
